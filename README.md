- Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing. - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/diamonds?resource=download
- Use machine learning (ML) with the technologies weâ€™ve learned. - Linear regression model 
- You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library. - sklearn

1 - the average price of diamond for each carat range

2 - does the colour of the diamond predict its price?

3 - does the depth of the diamond predict its cut?

4 - which diamonds are most expensive type


Which coloumn we would need:

Carat of the diamond

Cut of the diamond

Depth of the diamond

Sale price of the diamond
