# Project4

# Bright like a diamond 

- Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing. - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/diamonds?resource=download
- Use machine learning (ML) with the technologies weâ€™ve learned. - Linear regression model 
- You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library. - sklearn 
- Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records. - done (there are 50)
- You must use at least two of the following:
- Python Pandas (and numpy)
- SQL Database
- Tableau



### Questions to potentially ask:

1 - the average price of diamond for each carat range

2 - does the colour of the diamond predict its price?

3 - does the depth of the diamond predict its cut?

4 - which diamonds are most expensive type





### ~To do:

- Data Extraction, Cleaning - James - *Panda*
- Make string coloumns numerical ( foe examples b'Ideal equal to 1) - James
- Data analysis (option)
-- Building the Linear regression model - Dalitso
- Testing the Linear regression model - Dalitso
- Building the Neural Network - Tharu
- Testing the Neural Network - Tharu
- Push into *SQL dataset* - Jade
- *Tableau* (option)


- Creating documentation (assume readme)
- Creating the presentation

## REMEMBER SCREENSHOTS AS YOU GO :)
